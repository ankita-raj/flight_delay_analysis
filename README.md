# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis with PySpark & Databricks

This project explores and analyzes flight delay data using **Apache Spark (PySpark)** on **Databricks Community Edition**. It demonstrates a basic data engineering workflow: data ingestion, cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Load real-world airline delay data
- Clean the dataset by identifying and removing null-heavy columns
- Calculate average arrival and departure delays by airline carrier
- Visualize the aggregated results using `matplotlib`

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Sign up for [Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Attach a cluster (you can use the default settings)
4. Copy and paste the code from `flight_delay_analysis.ipynb` or import it directly
5. Run the cells one by one
6. Visualizations will appear inside the notebook
